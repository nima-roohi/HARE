Hybrid Abstraction Refinement Engine (HARE)
===========================================

HARE (Hybrid Abstraction-Refinement Engine) is a counterexample guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR) based tool to verify safety properties of hybrid automata, whose continuous dynamics in each mode is non-linear, but initial values, invariants, and transition relations are specified using polyhedral constraints. 
HARE works by abstracting non-linear hybrid automata into hybrid automata with polyhedral inclusion dynamics, and uses [dReach](http://dreal.github.io/dReach/) to validate counterexamples. The CEGAR framework forming the theoretical basis of HARE, makes provable progress in each iteration of the abstraction-refinement loop. The current HARE tool is a significant advance on previous versions of HARE; it considers a richer class of abstract models (polyhedral flows as opposed to rectangular flows), and can be applied to a larger class of concrete models (non-linear hybrid automata as opposed to affine hybrid automata). These advances have led to better performance results for a wider class of examples. In the tool's [page](https://nima-roohi.github.io/HARE), we report our experimental comparison of HARE against other state of the art tools for affine models ([SpaceEx](http://spaceex.imag.fr/), [PHAVer](http://spaceex.imag.fr/phaver-8), and [SpaceEx AGAR](https://swt.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/tool/spaceex/agar)) and non-linear models ([FLOW*](https://flowstar.org/), [HSolver](http://hsolver.sourceforge.net/), and [C2E2](http://publish.illinois.edu/c2e2-tool/)).
Here we explain how to install and run benchmarks as well as examples.
